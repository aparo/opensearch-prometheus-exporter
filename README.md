# Prometheus Exporter Plugin for OpenSearch

This is a builtin exporter from OpenSearch to Prometheus based on the code of Vincent Van Hollebeke and others at https://github.com/vvanholl/elasticsearch-prometheus-exporter .
It collects all relevant metrics and makes them available to Prometheus via the OpenSearch REST API.

**Currently, the available metrics are:**

- Cluster status
- Nodes status:
    - JVM
    - Indices (global)
    - Transport
    - HTTP
    - Scripts
    - Process
    - Operating System
    - File System
    - Circuit Breaker
- Indices status
- Cluster settings

## Compatibility matrix

### Versions

| OpenSearch  | Plugin         | Release date |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 1.0.0-RC1   | 1.0.0-RC1      | Jun 24, 2021 |

## Install

`./bin/opensearch-plugin install -b https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-prometheus-exporter/releases/download/1.0.0-RC1/prometheus-exporter-1.0.0-RC1.zip`

**Do not forget to restart the node after the installation!**

Note that the plugin needs the following special permissions:

- java.lang.RuntimePermission accessClassInPackage.sun.misc
- java.lang.RuntimePermission accessDeclaredMembers
- java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission suppressAccessChecks

If you have a lot of indices and think this data is irrelevant, you can disable in the main configuration file:

```
prometheus.indices: false
```

To disable exporting cluster settings use:
```
prometheus.cluster.settings: false
```

These settings can be also [updated dynamically](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/master/cluster-update-settings.html).

## Uninstall

`./bin/opensearch-plugin remove prometheus-exporter`

Do not forget to restart the node after installation!

## Usage

Metrics are directly available at:

    http://<your-opensearch-host>:9200/_prometheus/metrics

As a sample result, you get:

```
# HELP es_process_mem_total_virtual_bytes Memory used by ES process
# TYPE es_process_mem_total_virtual_bytes gauge
es_process_mem_total_virtual_bytes{cluster="develop",node="develop01",} 3.626733568E9
# HELP es_indices_indexing_is_throttled_bool Is indexing throttling ?
# TYPE es_indices_indexing_is_throttled_bool gauge
es_indices_indexing_is_throttled_bool{cluster="develop",node="develop01",} 0.0
# HELP es_jvm_gc_collection_time_seconds Time spent for GC collections
# TYPE es_jvm_gc_collection_time_seconds counter
es_jvm_gc_collection_time_seconds{cluster="develop",node="develop01",gc="old",} 0.0
es_jvm_gc_collection_time_seconds{cluster="develop",node="develop01",gc="young",} 0.0
# HELP es_indices_requestcache_memory_size_bytes Memory used for request cache
# TYPE es_indices_requestcache_memory_size_bytes gauge
es_indices_requestcache_memory_size_bytes{cluster="develop",node="develop01",} 0.0
# HELP es_indices_search_open_contexts_number Number of search open contexts
# TYPE es_indices_search_open_contexts_number gauge
es_indices_search_open_contexts_number{cluster="develop",node="develop01",} 0.0
# HELP es_jvm_mem_nonheap_used_bytes Memory used apart from heap
# TYPE es_jvm_mem_nonheap_used_bytes gauge
es_jvm_mem_nonheap_used_bytes{cluster="develop",node="develop01",} 5.5302736E7

...
```

### Configure the Prometheus target

On your Prometheus servers, configure a new job as usual.

For example, if you have a cluster of 3 nodes:

```YAML
- job_name: opensearch
  scrape_interval: 10s
  metrics_path: "/_prometheus/metrics"
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - node1:9200
    - node2:9200
    - node3:9200
```

Of course, you could use the service discovery service instead of a static config.

Just keep in mind that `metrics_path` must be `/_prometheus/metrics`, otherwise Prometheus will find no metric.

If you enable security in OpenSearch, remember to set up the credentials also in Prometheus configuration.
